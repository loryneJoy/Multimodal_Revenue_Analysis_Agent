# 📊 Revenue Multimodal System

## 📁 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a system designed to analyze and respond to queries about **revenue data** using both **structured (tabular)** and **unstructured (text/image)** data. It was built as part of a data science and AI bootcamp assignment and serves as a portfolio-ready project showcasing skills in multimodal AI, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an intelligent system capable of:

* Retrieving relevant information from structured and unstructured data sources.
* Generating context-aware answers to natural language queries.
* Enhancing revenue analysis insights through multimodal retrieval (text + images + tables).

## 🧠 Key Features

* **RAG Architecture:** Combines retrieval (knowledge base search) with generative AI (LLM) to produce high-quality answers.
* **Multimodal Input:** Processes text, tables, and images to provide richer responses.
* **Dynamic Query Handling:** Answers revenue-related questions based on stored company data.
* **Scalable Workflow:** Designed for future integration with APIs, dashboards, or chat interfaces.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Jupyter/Google Colab** – Development environment
* **LangChain** – Orchestrating retrieval and LLM workflows
* **Pandas / NumPy** – Data cleaning and processing
* **Hugging Face Transformers** – NLP and embeddings
* **Vector Databases (FAISS / Chroma)** – Efficient document retrieval
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization

## 📂 Notebook Structure

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Importing and cleaning revenue data from multiple sources.
2. **Embedding & Indexing:** Converting data into vector representations for retrieval.
3. **Retriever Setup:** Creating a retriever pipeline to query the vector database.
4. **RAG Pipeline Construction:** Integrating retriever with a generative model.
5. **Query Execution:** Asking revenue-related questions and generating answers.
6. **Visualization:** Displaying insights with charts and tables.

## 📊 Example Use Cases

* *"What was the revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1?"*
* *"Which product category contributed the most revenue last year?"*
* *"Visualize revenue trends over the last 5 years."*

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* Deploy as an API endpoint or chatbot.
* Add real-time data ingestion from external sources (e.g., databases or APIs).
* Integrate image-based revenue reports for document parsing.
* Implement fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs for financial analysis.
